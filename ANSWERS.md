### Process

- Write the semantic markup, review and make edits.

- Write the react starter app, plan to use useState for the tabs. 
- Add enough structure to support the design without getting into heavy styling.
- Review and make edits.

- Begin to add styles using mobile-first responsive philosophy.
- Most likely using scss over styled components here.

- Polishing

### Tabs

Being mindful that the length of the content in the tabs may differ.
Consider using css transition on max-height

Depending on the use case the tab content can be generated from data otherwise
Im going to keep the HTML tidy

this section has a full bleed with 1px solid lines on top and bottom
indicating how the wrappers are working

### Cards
          
Headings on a document should work as an outline so screen readers can understand the "outline" of what you are saying regardless of the visuals

Each blurb has an arrow link at the bottom of the card that presumably goes to a URL

Use article tags for the article-looking summaries
Which allows for the use of a footer or nav tag in the cta

I am pretty sure the title of the blurb should also go the same URL

Even though the visual weight is similar to an h2, semantically the big blue text is a title and:

Creative 
User Experience 
Data and Analytics 

are the outline-level headings.

### Discussion
- Double check with the designer if there's a grid system in place
--- Would help with the padding/spacing in the hero and also in the content area of the tabs
- Typescale and spacing
