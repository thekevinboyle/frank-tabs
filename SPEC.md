# Viget Front-End Developer Buildout Exercise

The purpose of this challenge is to evaluate your combined knowledge of markup (HTML), styling (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript) — the core skills for every front-end developer.

## Instructions

### General

- Build out the design to the best of your ability. If you're unable to complete any portion of the buildout for whatever reason, list what you weren't able to get to and how you might have approached it.
- Use the included `ANSWERS.md` file for your explanations. Feel free to also use code comments to describe what you're doing — we'll be looking!
- You may take as long to complete the challenge as you need. We recommend that you restrict yourself to about 4 hours and use this limitation to help you make decisions about what to focus on. In your answers, record how long you took to complete the build and explain how you prioritized your work.
- Use your preferred file structure, CSS conventions, and JavaScript syntax. Explain your decisions.
- Use any build tools you're comfortable with and explain your preference for that toolset. If you use a compiler, be sure to include the pre-compiled code (e.g. `.scss` files) in the package you send us.
- Your buildout only needs to work in the current version of Chrome but explain browser incompatibilities your solution might have.

### Choose Your Buildout Challenge

This package contains two variations of the buildout. They both contain a feature that requires JavaScript to work. Choose the one that best suits your area of focus.

#### UI/Interface Focus: Tabbed Content

- Use `comp-tabs.png` for your build.
- Clicking a tab should change the content in the space occupied by the "Te pri legimus dissentiet..." text in the design.
- Use the text included below for the content of the tab containers.

#### Application Development Focus: API Interaction

- Use `comp-api.png` for your build.
- Use any JavaScript library of your choosing (or none).
- Load the JSON data from `data/results.json` _as if it was coming from an external API_ to populate the article list.
- Display the first four results from the data set.
- Create links to load the rest of the results in sets of four. Depending on your approach and library chosen, you may break up the `results.json` file into individual files to simulate individual API calls (e.g. `results-1.json`, `results-2.json`, etc.).

### Styling

- In this exercise, a responsive design is missing! The included design comp is for larger screens but the buildout needs to work down to 320px wide (iPhone 5/SE). You are responsible for adapting the design to work on smaller screens.

### Extras (if you have time)

- Be creative with hover and transition animations.
- Ensure that your work is accessible to people using keyboards and screen readers.
- Are there any performance concerns with this design? What techniques could help improve the loading or perceived loading experience?

### When You're Finished

- Send the completed challenge back to us.
- Because Gmail [blocks JavaScript file attachments](https://www.engadget.com/2017/01/26/gmail-block-javascript-attachments/), it's recommended that you upload the package to Google Drive or another file sharing service and send a link.

## Assets

All necessary assets have been extracted and listed below so you can build out the design with minimal software requirements.

Feel free to manipulate the images in any way you need to complete the build.

### Images

- `images/hero.jpg` is for the main hero/header image.
- `images/article/*.jpg` are the article images used for the API buildout challenge.

### Data (if applicable)

- `data/results.json` is the JSON file that needs to be loaded for the API buildout challenge.
